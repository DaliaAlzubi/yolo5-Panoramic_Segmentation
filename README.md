Welocome to Yolo5 Panoramic images segmentation.



This Repo has been forked from the official yolov5 segmentation repo.

Using Yolov5 segmentation, I achieved 0.81 (MAP50) for Bounding_Box(detection) and 0.708(MAP50) for Mask (Segmenation) on a test data of 211 images of panoramic images of five classes.

This is the the precision-recall curve for the five different classes (Bounding Box)

Also, this is the precision-recall curve for the five different classes (Mask Segmenation)
